# Password Security Analysis and Best Practices

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this task was to understand the fundamental components of a *strong password, test the effectiveness of various password complexities, and research the **common attack vectors* used to compromise user accounts.
## Objectives
The main goals of this task were to:

* *Analyze Password Strength:* Create and test passwords with varying lengths, characters, and complexity using an online password strength checker.
* *Identify Best Practices:* Formulate best practices and tips for creating highly secure, resilient passwords.
* *Research Attack Methods:* Document and explain common password attacks, including *Brute Force, **Dictionary Attacks, and **Credential Stuffing*.
* *Summarize Security Impact:* Evaluate how complexity directly impacts security and defense against automated attacks.

## Key Findings & Deliverables
1. Password Evaluation
The report includes a comparative analysis (with strength scores and time-to-crack estimates) of various password examples, clearly demonstrating the exponential increase in security gained by using:
* A *longer character length* (12+ characters).
* A mix of *uppercase, **lowercase, **numbers, and **symbols*.

2. Common Password Attacks Explained
The report details the mechanics of four major threats:
Attack Method 
 *Brute Force* - Systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. 
 *Dictionary Attack* - Using pre-compiled lists of common words, names, and leaked passwords against an account. 
 *Credential Stuffing* - Utilizing a list of compromised usernames and passwords (from a data breach) to try and log into other services, exploiting user *password reuse*. 
 *Phishing / Keylogging* - Social engineering or malware attacks designed to trick a user into directly giving away their login credentials. 

3. Best Practices for Strong Password Creation
 * *Avoid Common Mistakes:* Do not use personal information (birthdays, names) or sequential patterns (123456).
 * *Use a Password Manager:* Utilize a trusted password manager to generate and securely store unique, complex passwords for every single service.
 * *Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):* Add an extra layer of security beyond the password.
